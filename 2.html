 <p><strong><u>History & Future</u></strong><br><br></P>
<p>I want to walk the path of a venture with the belief that venture is the only way to live in Korea.<br>
I had two businessmen I respected.It was my uncle who worked in the electricity business in Changwon Industrial Complex and my father who worked in the heavy industry. <br>
They were both working day and night for home and for the country, but they grew up suffering from sluggish manufacturing, mid- and high-end businesses and the economic downturn.<br>
 At that time, I had the idea that the future of Korea was not in the factory chimney, but in creative ideas. <br>
 After entering college in science and engineering, I flew to San Jose, the home of the venture, with the determination to become a venture businessman.<br>
  With the help of my friend, I went to Korean startups such as Siddbird and Olgagazer as well as large companies such as Facebook and Apple to feel the venture.<br>
  What became clearer in my heart after I came back to Korea was that small technology could enrich the world.

I am planning to create a new company by cultivating the special studies of computer engineering information and communication technology and venture studies that I majored in. <br>
I want to create new value by fusing and connecting existing ideas.<br>

The venture company that I want to create and dream of is a network platform company that combines <a href="https://about.fb.com/ko/" target="_blank" title="facebook infomation">Facebook</a>,
<a href="https://www.apple.com/kr/" target="_black" title="apple information">apple</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_black" title="Amazon information">Amazon</a>.<br>
 I want to build a platform that brings together all the world's leading companies such as venture companies and start-ups. <br>
 If Silicon Valley in the U.S. exists offline, we want to create a huge network platform company that allows everything in Silicon Valley to be done online.<br>

A variety of start-up companies in the world want to create an online Silicon Valley where they listen to each other, collaborate and coexist. <br>
I'm trying to create a world where you can create new companies anytime, anywhere, with technology and ideas beyond your country, your school and your background.<br>
 The company that I'm going to grow up in will be at the center of this world.<br>

The platform company I will grow is not just a profit-seeking company, but a company that contributes to the prosperity and coexistence of society.<br>
 Furthermore, it will change biased nationalism, and a new free economic market will be pioneered<br></P>
